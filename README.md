# Customer-Relationship-Management
Project Overview
The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Progressive Web App (PWA) for Student-Faculty interactions is designed to enhance communication and collaboration between students and faculties in an educational institution. This PWA facilitates seamless and responsive communication, enabling students to interact with faculties efficiently and vice versa. The project is based on a progressive web app architecture, ensuring cross-platform accessibility and a consistent user experience across various devices.
